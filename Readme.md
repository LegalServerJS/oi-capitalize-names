# Capitalize Names in Online Intake

When visitors fill out online intakes, CLS found that they often use inconsistend capitalization in their names. Staff then needed to edit names to fix capitalization issues.

This javascript doodad attempts to regularize the capitalization of names. It won't work all the time (for example, it only works when a name is a single word), but its goal is just to reduce the number of times intake staff have to edit the names by hand later.

To test it out yourself, you can simply open the tryme.html file in a web browser (after downloading it). 

To use it in Online Intake, open the file in a text editor and copy the `<script>` tag into a LegalServer Instruction on the form you'd like it to work on.
